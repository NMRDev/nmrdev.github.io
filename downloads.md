Here we can find some utilities as pulse sequences, and NMR related software.

## Pulse sequences

### Gradient selected NOESY with ZQC supression through random placement of the 180º central pulse
This is a variation of the noesygpph Bruker pulse sequence which randomly modifies the placement of the 180º 
pulse in the middle of the mixing time period in order to supress the unwanted zero quantum coherences. The percentange of variation of the half-mixing time periods is given through
the cnst8 constant (a 5% value should work in most of the cases). You can donwload it [here](noesygpph_random)

The NMRDev group at the Department of Fundamental Chemistry (Universidade Federal de Pernambuco) focuses in the development of materials and computational methodologies with application to structural elucidation studies by liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance.

## NMR aligning media

### Chromonic liquid crystals
We are interested in the synthesis, study and application in structural elucidation studies of the so-called [chromonic liquid crystals](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1359-0294(98)80019-8) as weakly-alinging media in NMR, such as, for instance, those based on the bis(perylene diimide) motif. 
### Polymer gels
Another type of NMR weakly-aligning media are those based on cross-linked polymer gels. Several polymers and copolymers, compatible with organic solvents, aqueous solutions, and even ionic liquids have been reported by our laboratory.
